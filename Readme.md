# Ruby Meme

Exploration with Ruby's rbs gem for static types being added to Ruby 3.

Code/test suite inspired by the examples in the minitest test suite examples, credit/thanks to seattlerb.

## Playing around

* `rake` will always run the test suite
* "Application Code" lives in `lib/*.rb`
* Type Signatures for methods are in `sig/*.rbs`
* Tests live in `test/*_test.rb`
